This is a script to manage to-do lists - my first ever Python project!
The script does the following:
- Asking user for the file path to the existing to-do list the user would like to amend
- If the user wants to create a new to-do list, the scrips creates a new file
- The user modifies the to-do list with add and remove commands
- The amended list is saved automatically when the user exits the program.
